> Embed machine-readable context directly in your codebase so AI coding assistants understand your code's structure, constraints, and intent.

---

## The Problem

AI coding assistants are powerful, but they don't understand *your* codebase:

- They don't know which files are frozen in production and must never be modified
- They can't see your domain boundaries or architectural layers
- They miss the "tribal knowledge" that lives in your team's heads
- They treat every line of code the same, regardless of criticality

**The result?** AI assistants suggest changes to code they shouldn't touch, miss important context, and require constant correction.

---

## The Solution

ACP provides a simple, standard way to annotate your code with machine-readable context that AI assistants can consume:

```typescript
// @acp:domain auth - Authentication and authorization
// @acp:lock frozen - Critical security code, DO NOT modify
// @acp:owner security-team - Contact before changes

export class SessionValidator {
  // @acp:fn "Validates JWT tokens - security critical"
  validateToken(token: string): boolean {
    // ...
  }
}
```

Run `acp index` to generate a cache file that any AI tool can read:

```bash
$ acp index
✓ Indexed 247 files
✓ Found 1,842 symbols  
✓ Detected 12 domains
✓ Generated .acp.cache.json
```

Now your AI assistant knows:
- Which code is frozen and why
- How your codebase is organized into domains
- Who owns what and who to ask
- What each function does at a glance

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Constraints** | Mark code as `frozen`, `restricted`, or `approval-required` |
| **Domains** | Organize code by business domain (auth, payments, users) |
| **Layers** | Define architectural layers (api, service, data) |
| **Ownership** | Specify team ownership for accountability |
| **Variables** | Token-efficient references that expand to full context |
| **Call Graphs** | Understand what calls what across your codebase |

```

1. **Annotate** — Add `@acp:` annotations in your code comments
2. **Index** — Run `acp index` to generate the cache
3. **Integrate** — AI tools read the cache and respect your constraints

## Supported Languages

ACP works with any language that has comments. Built-in parsing support for:

| Language | Extensions | Parser |
|----------|------------|--------|
| TypeScript | `.ts`, `.tsx` | tree-sitter |
| JavaScript | `.js`, `.jsx`, `.mjs` | tree-sitter |
| Python | `.py` | tree-sitter |
| Rust | `.rs` | tree-sitter |
| Go | `.go` | tree-sitter |
| Java | `.java` | tree-sitter |

Other languages work with comment-based annotations (no AST parsing).

## Conformance Levels

Implementations can claim different levels of ACP conformance:

| Level | Name | Capabilities |
|-------|------|--------------|
| 1 | Reader | Parse cache files, respect constraints |
| 2 | Standard | Level 1 + CLI, cache generation |
| 3 | Full | Level 2 + MCP server, real-time sync |
