# Welcome to ACP

The **AI Context Protocol (ACP)** is an open standard for controlling how AI coding assistants interact with your codebase. It enables you to:

- **Protect sensitive code** from being shared with AI models
- **Provide context efficiently** without overwhelming token limits
- **Maintain security** while leveraging AI development tools

## Quick Start

Get started with ACP in minutes:

1. [Introduction](/docs/getting-started/introduction) - Learn what ACP is and why you need it
2. [Terminology](/docs/getting-started/terminology) - Understand key concepts
3. [Annotations](/docs/core-concepts/annotations) - Add ACP annotations to your code

## Core Concepts

- [Annotations](/docs/core-concepts/annotations) - Mark up your code with ACP directives
- [Constraints](/docs/core-concepts/constraints) - Define access policies
- [Variables](/docs/core-concepts/variables) - Dynamic content in annotations
- [Inheritance](/docs/core-concepts/inheritance) - How annotations propagate

## Examples

Check out practical examples to see ACP in action:

- [Minimal Example](/docs/examples/minimal) - A basic ACP setup
- [Complete Example](/docs/examples/complete) - Full-featured implementation
- [Edge Cases](/docs/examples/edge-cases) - Handling special scenarios
